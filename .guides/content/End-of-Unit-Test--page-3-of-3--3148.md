# Solution
The CPU of a computer cannot understand **hexadecimal** and never, ever uses it.
It is used to help **humans** cope with long strings of **binary digits**.
It is often used to represent **24 bit** colour codes.

# Solution
A digital image is composed of many small points of colour called **pixels**. 
The **size** of an image is given as the number along its **height** followed by the number along its **width**.

# Solution
When an image is enlarged to display it in paper or a screen its **resolution** is reduced. 
The **colour depth** is the number of bits used to **encode** the colour of each **pixel**. 
If 8 bits are used then **256** can be defined for each one.

# Solution
Extra data stored with an image file is called **metadata**. 
It can include the **date** when the image was made, details about the **camera** and the **location** where it was taken if the camera has **GPS** facilities.

# Solution
Sound is caused by **vibrations** that travel in **waves**. 
Digital recordings are made by **sampling** them at fixed intervals. 
The higher the **sampling frequency** the more **accurate** is the recording.

# Solution
The **dynamic range** is influenced by the **sample size** which stipulates how many **bits** are used to **encode** each one. 
The **bit rate** is the amount of **data** processed each **second**.

# Solution
A stereo recording of 3 minutes with a sampling frequency of 44.1 KHz and a sample size of 24 bits = **47** megabytes

# Solution
File **compression** reduces file sizes so that they take up less **storage** space and require less **bandwidth** when they are transmitted across the **internet**.

# Solution
The **lossy** compression algorithm removes **data** from the file and is suitable for **image** and sound files as they contain **information** which humans cannot distinguish.

# Solution
It cannot be used for **text** files as there would be **missing** letters and words. Therefore **lossless** compression must be used for these files.
